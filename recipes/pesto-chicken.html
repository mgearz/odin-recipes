    <p>Pesto Chicken, it sounds fancy doesn't it? In reality this is one of the easiest recipes out there, and it's guaranteed to make you look like a pro chef. It requires only <strong>5 minutes</strong> prep and only <strong>4 basic ingredients:</strong> chicken, basil pesto, mozzarella, and fresh tomatoes.</p>

    <h3>What You'll Need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive Oil (or Butter)</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Chicken Breasts (3)</li>
        <li>Medium-Sized Tomatoes (2)</li>
        <li>Fresh Mozzarella Cheese</li>
        <li>Basil Pesto (1 jar; 6oz.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Let's Get Cooking!</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350° F. Season chicken breasts liberally with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While the oven is preheating you can heat some olive oil or butter in a skillet. Once hot add the chicken breast and sear for 1-2 minutes on each side until caramelized. The chicken should still be raw in the center.</li>
        <li>Arrange the seared chicken breasts onto a baking dish or rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to cover chicken with pesto.</li>
        <li>Top each chicken breast with 2 slices of fresh mozzarella cheese and 2 tomato slices.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes (time will vary depending on thickness of chicken) until chicken is 165º F. Broil the chicken the final 2 minutes so that the cheese is bubbly and golden. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>

The Odin Recipe Website Project

This is the first project for the Foundations course of "The Odin Project".

It has been designed to help me put all the basic principles into use that we've learned so far. This includes using:
 - the Command Line (Terminal)
 - Git
 - HTML

By the end of this project, I will have built a basic recipe website, with an index page and links to a few recipes. The website will be very brutalist to begin as it will be nothing but HTML framework.

Using the skills acquired in the "CSS Foundations" course, I began to experiment with basic CSS styling of the typography. It also gave me a chance to practice using Class and ID Selectors, and Grouping. A CSS file has been added (style.css) to reflect the changes.

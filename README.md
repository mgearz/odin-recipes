The Odin Recipe Website Project

This is the first project for the Foundations course of "The Odin Project".

It has been designed to help me put all the basic principles into use that we've learned so far. This includes using:
 - the Command Line (Terminal)
 - Git
 - HTML

By the end of this project, I will have built a basic recipe website, with an index page and links to a few recipes. The website will be very brutalist to begin as it will be nothing but HTML framework.
